# About

I am currently a Data Scientist at [Development Data Lab](https://www.devdatalab.org) where I help in their mission to make Indian governmental and administrative data easier to use. I studied Masters in Public Policy at the [Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy](https://lkyspp.nus.edu.sg). Before that, I was a Software Engineer at [Semantics3](https://www.semantics3.com) where I was primarily involved in managing their internal ETL (_Extract-Transform-Load_) data pipeline. I have a good amount of experience in Web Crawling, Process Automation, Server side scripting and Database management from my previous jobs.
