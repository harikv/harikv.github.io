# About

I am currently studying for a Master in Public Policy degree at the [Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy](https://lkyspp.nus.edu.sg). Previously, I was a Software Engineer at [Semantics3](https://www.semantics3.com) where I was primarily involved in managing their internal ETL (_Extract-Transform-Load_) data pipeline. I have a good amount of experience in Web Crawling, Process Automation, Server side scripting and Database management from my previous jobs. I'm currently learning about Quantitative Policy Research, Cost-Benefit Analyses, Natural Language Processing among other things as part of my coursework and research interests.
